    "- **Extreme waves are waves that are significantly larger than the preceding and subsequent waves. Although the occurrence of these events have a low probability of occurrence, the  impact of these waves can nevertheless be devastating causing serious damage to ships, offshore structures, and people on board them.**\n",
    "- **These extreme waves are also called *freak* or *rogue* waves and can be loosely defined as waves that are significantly higher than the surrounding waves.**\n",
    "- **A more precise definition can be stated by relating a local wave height measure, either the wave height $H$ (from trough to crest) or the crest height $\\eta_c$ to the   significant wave height $H_s$. Therein, the significant wave height, which is defined as four times the standard deviation of the sea surface elevation, provides a measure for the average wave height. If the wave height $H$ exceeds the significant wave height by a factor of 2.0 (or alternatively 2.2), then the corresponding wave is a rogue wave. An alternative definition requires the crest height $\\eta_c$ to exceed the significant wave height $H_s$ by a factor of 1.25.**"
