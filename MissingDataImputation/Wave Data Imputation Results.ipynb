    "**The workflow of the missing data imputation process followed for the different experiments in this study. Observations obtained from three different buoys in different water depths have been used to create gaps of different lengths in time sequences. The peaks and troughs extracted from these sequences are used to obtain slowly varying amplitudes in the wave sequence through minimization of a cost function based on a wave model. The resultant amplitudes are then used for the missing data imputation either by using interpolation for the linear SSA model or extrapolation for the neural networks. A sample result of the missing data imputation process has been also depicted.**"

The imputed peaks from the different models are plotted at the time instants of the true peaks for ease of comparison. The fit is found to show excellent agreement with the true peaks here. The non-linear CNN + LSTM model is found to do a very good job of capturing the highest wave peak in the data gap at index 47 (at around 14.00 min in the figure). Overall, it provides the most robust predictions over the entire window, followed by the LSTM model and is found to outperform the SSA method in capturing the highest peak within the data gap.**\n"
